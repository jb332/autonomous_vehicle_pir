	abstract = {Every revolution promises a spirit of optimism and significant changes. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are coming to our roadways. CAVs have a crucial role to play in the future of transportation. These emerging technologies will provide a safe travel mode by eliminating the human driving error. The CAVs are never distracted or tired. In the last five years, autonomous driving has gone from “may be possible” to “inevitable”. Beyond safer and more enjoyable routes for passengers, the autonomous car also represents a significant step forward in terms of sustainable development. However, many questions remaining under investigations, when will autonomous cars be available? What should be improved first, vehicles or infrastructures? What are the requirements that must be satisfied by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in smart and sustainable cities? How will these modern technologies impact our transportation systems and the social world? What and how the leading technologies can be used in autonomous cars? What type of sensors and embedded devices to be used? In this paper, we address those issues and to try to provide some suggestions for these technologies that are currently emerging.},

	abstract = {The development of intelligent autonomous cars is of great interest. A particular and challenging problem is to handle pedestrians, for example, crossing or walking along the road. Since pedestrians are one of the most fragile elements in traffic, a reliable pedestrian detection and handling system is mandatory. The current pedestrian handling system of our autonomous cars suffers from the limitation of the pure detection-based systems, i.e., it limits the autonomous car system to make decisions based only on the very present moment. This work improves the pedestrian handling systems by incorporating an object tracker with the aim of predicting the pedestrian’s behavior. With this knowledge, the autonomous car can better decide the time to stop and to start moving, providing a more comfortable, efficient, and safer driving experience. The proposed method was augmented with a path generator, based on Frenét Frames, and incorporated to our self-driving car in order to enable a better decision making and to enable overtaking pedestrians. The behaviour of our self-driving car was evaluated in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Results showed the proposed system is safer and more efficient than the system without tracking functionality due to the early decision capability.},

	abstract = {Urban mobility is a dynamic system that has had a (slow) natural evolution. Scientists and engineers are currently developing new mobility technologies. A progressive paradigm shift will change everything from the fuel type to the way of driving vehicles. Vehicles will progressively become autonomous and will communicate and cooperate with each other. In the long run, profound changes are expected in mobility as a service. Furthermore, urban areas will have a higher level of development, and cities will likely turn into Smart Cities in which the vehicles will interact with the urban infrastructure. The main objective of this paper is to explore the macroscopic effects of mobility interaction in a radial-circular urban road system for current and future cities (Smart Cities). In the literature, there is documentation of the direct effects of autonomous vehicles, but some indirect effects will cause undesirable impacts such as an increase in demand and more congestion, which change the demand behavior and the urban structure. Finally, this paper exhibits the results of direct and indirect effects calculated through analytical tools (Continuous Approximation Method). In fact, our research shows that if demand increases by about 50\%, the current scenario could have the same total cost as the future scenario with autonomous vehicles. Moreover, if the city radius increases by about 33\% and the subjective value of time decreases about 20\%, the benefits of the autonomous cars will be compensated. Therefore, the paper proves that autonomous vehicles could encourage the urban sprawl in the long run. Finally, Administrations should define transport strategies and policies to control these externalities, because autonomous driving could deteriorate mobility even worse than it is now.},

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a subsystem to handle pedestrians in crosswalks using deep neural networks for the IARA autonomous car, which relies on camera and LIDAR data fusion. Crosswalks' positions were manually annotated in IARA's map. Pedestrians are detected in the camera image using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Then, pedestrians' positions in the map are obtained by fusing their positions in the image with the LIDAR point cloud. Subsequently, if a pedestrian position is inside the crosswalk area, the crosswalk is set as busy. Finally, a busy crosswalk message is published to the High-Level Decision Maker subsystem. This subsystem selects the car's behavior according to the crosswalk condition and propagates this decision down through the control pipeline, in order to make the car drive correctly through the crosswalk area. The Pedestrian Handler subsystem was evaluated on IARA, which was driven autonomously for various laps along a real and complex circuit with various crosswalks. In all passages through crosswalks, the Pedestrian Handler dealt with pedestrians as expected, i.e., without any human intervention.},
